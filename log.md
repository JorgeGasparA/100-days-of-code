# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25 September, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 10 lessons in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Functional Programing section (2-12)


**Thoughts:** I did 10 lessons, that is not a lot, but considering is my first day and I'm going through a lot, I think is a decent amount. Even tho I was familiar with functional programing concepts beforehand, I hadn't fully understand some of them yet. Writing my own versions of map, filter also helped a little to undertand how a pure function is written. I hope this week I'm able to start the certification exercises.

### Day 2: 26 September, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 8 lessons in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Functional Programing section (13-20). Almost done with the section!


**Thoughts:** I did 8 lessons today.2 less than yesterday, however this time there were more complex, and utilized other concepts seen in previous sections. I feel my concentration improved since yesterday. It is always good to remember and practice map, filter, reduce, sort, splice, slice, split, join, and all the other cool built-in functions. This kind of tools are what make me like JS.

### Day 3: 27 September, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 4 lessons in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Functional Programing section (21-24) and started Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (1-4)


**Thoughts:** I finally finished the functional programing section. Learned about some() and every(). I think I had not used them before. I started the algorithms section, a subject I very much enjoy. I lost a lot of time in the first one trying to come up with a super creative and short way of solving it. It didn't work. I think I almost wasted 20 minutes. Then I gave up with the fancy solution and solved it in like 2 minutes. I have to stop trying to do that all the time. I am very happy with my solutions

### Day 4: 28 September, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 4 lessons in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (5-8) section


**Thoughts:** I spent more than one hour trying to solve these. I used regular expressions on most of them, which simplified A LOT the code, and ultimately were the best answer to them. I am happy because six months ago I didn't know anything about RegEx, and couldn't solve this kind of algorithms. I still have a lot to improve and to learn from them. One step closer to the certification excercises. 

**Link to work:** [I added a folder with all the algorithm excercises, and the two lessons I mentioned in Day 2](https://github.com/JorgeGasparA/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Projects/freeCodeCamp/javascript-algorithms-and-datastructures)

### Day 5: 29 September, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 4 more lessons in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (9-12) section


**Thoughts:** We're halfway there! Man, these are hard hahaha. RegEx couldn't save me this time . However I feel happy with the results, the code is simple and readable, I'd like to think. I would have liked to use recursion, at least in the fibonacci one (#12). I'm gonna add it to my //ToDo list

### Day 6: 1st of October, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 2 algorithms in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (13-14) section, and started reading about viable and modern .NET approachs to do a web app from scratch


**Thoughts:** I skipped yesterday, however today I not only invested more than one hour an a half solving these problems, I spent other 2 hours watching the different .NET options to make a web app from the ground up. I think I am gonna be inclined to .Net MVC with React front end. Must learn those two,

### Day 7: 5 October, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 6 algorithms in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting (15-20) section, and started a react full course 

**Thoughts:** I skipped the weekend and monday, but it was worth it tbh. Today I decided to spent as much as I can only with code, putting aside other projects I had in mind. Just one more algoritm before the true projects begin. I am gonna to commit now, but I'll try to solve the last one and star the projects tomorrow.

### Day 8: 7 October, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did the last lesson from JS course en freeCodeCamp, and the first certification Project! I also spent a cople of hours with React components!

**Thoughts:** I now know the basics of react components and props, finished the Section 3 from the react course. Finished my last algorithm and my first certification project, both were easier than expected

### Day 9: 8 October, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did the last 4 certification projects from JS freeCodeCamp, and earned my certification!

**Thoughts:** I did it, I ACTUALLY DID IT. Took me aproximately 6 hours to end all four, but I was not gonna quit, not being this close
