# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 25 September, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I did 10 lessons in Javascript Algorithms and Data structures on Functional Programing section (2-12)


**Thoughts:** I did 10 lessons, that is not a lot, but considering is my first day and I'm going through a lot, I think is a decent amount. Even tho I was familiar with functional programing concepts beforehand, I hadn't fully understand some of them yet. Writing my own versions of map, filter also helped a little to undertand how a pure function is written. I hope this week I'm able to start the certification exercises.
