            CSS (<strong>C</strong>ascade <strong>S</strong>tyle
            <strong>S</strong>heets) is a styling language, used mostly in
            websites (there are some <em>crazy</em> ways to use it for desktop
            apps), it indicates the browser how to visually render the content
            of a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different from markup languages, like <em>HTML</em> that sets the
            structure of the elemets that conform a page, or programming
            languages, like <em>JavaScript</em> that controls the data flow and
            logic, CSS sets the way the elements of the page
            <em><strong>look</strong></em
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means the color, the position, decoration and even animation of
            the elements set in the HTML Document. In the browser, each element
            has a set of properties that control the way it looks, if we don't
            set such properties in an explicit way, the browser assigns default
            values. This preset values often result in bland looking,
            unappealing and frecuently confusing webpages.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this guide, we will cover how to target an element (or group of
            elements), and change its style using the basic sintax of CSS.

            In order to fully understand and take advantage of this guide, you
            will need the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic HTML knowledge</li>
            <li>
              A text editor (doesn't have to be a code editor, notepad would do
              the trick too)
            </li>
            <li>A computer might come handy</li>
            <li>Being alive would be kinda helpful</li>
            <li>Class consciusness (not for CSS, but useful, in general)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Basic_sintax">
          <header class="section-header">Basic sintax</header>
          <p>
            Alright, understanding the basic sintax is very easy, because it
            follows always the same pattern. Let's define each part and then use
            it to build in an example, and in the end get to a basic "formula". 
            Let us say that we want to change the color of the text in the
             paragraphs on our page.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, you gotta tell CSS what element (or elements) you want to
            change. This can be achieved by using a
            <strong><em>Selector</em></strong
            >. You can <strong><em>Select</em></strong> elements in different
            ways, being the 3 most common:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML</strong> tag (eg: button, div, p)</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Class</strong> by using a dot before the name of the class
              (eg: .button_default, .main_div)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ID</strong> by using # as a prefix to the ID name (eg:
              #search_button, #main_content)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are, some others which will be covered in a little more depth
            later on the guide.
          </p>
          <p>For our example, lets say that we want to change the color of the text in all of our paragraph elements. We should start with the <strong>p</strong> selector</p>
          <code>
            p
          </code>
          <p>Then, we open and close curly brackets after our selector</p>
          <code>
            p{
              <br/>
              <br/>
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            In this case, every p elemet in our html document, will be displayed according to the 
            list of rules we define between said culry braces. <em>Unless we declare some exceptions</em>
            , but we will come to that later.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, if we wanted to make our paragraphs text color red, it would be as simple as:
          </p>
          <code>
            p{
              <br/>
              &nbsp;color: red;
              <br/>
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            Now, as we have a minimun consideration toward our poor readers, and know that reading 
            red text in white background is a pain to the eyes, we instead want to display a nice dark 
            color in the background, and a pleasing and easy to read bright color for text:
          </p>
          <code>
            p{
              <br/>
              &nbsp;color: whitesmoke;
              <br>
              &nbsp;background-color: #202224;
              <br/>
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            You might have noticed that we can select diferent colors using different ways. There are some named colors we can choose from
            and we can also select colors using hexadecimal codes, rgb, and others we will cover eventually.
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, we have something great already. We have discovered the basic sintax for CSS.
            EVERYTHING you could define with CSS, will be done with the following structure:
          </p>
          <code>
            [Selector]{
              <br/>
              &nbsp;[Property]: [Value];
              <br/>
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            We choose a selector, open and close curly brackets, and inside them we then list
            the property-value pairs we are interested in defining, each in a separate line and
            finishing with a semicolon.
          </p>
          <p>
            AND THAT'S IT! Now, let's talk about the different kind of selectors that exist in CSS.
